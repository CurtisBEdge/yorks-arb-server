This was the final project completed during the Eyup coding course. The app allows admins to create info pages for visitors to a site that can be accessed via signs with QR codes.
As well as adding info and images, it will also create the QR codes.

This was a full stack project, using React for the front end and Java with SQL for the back end. The project was completed over 2 weeks, with 1 sprint per week.
As the app may be getting some real world use, everything is fully tested, with many code reviews. This was the first time as a group that we had done such extensive testing
(unit, integration and end-to-end). Writing all of the tests ended up taking slightly longer than writing all of the code. I feel proud of what we've accomplished, 
and I feel it was an excellent end to a very challenging and rewarding course.
